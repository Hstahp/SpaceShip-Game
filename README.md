# SpaceShip Game Prototype
This is just a prototype project. I followed **C3 from SaiGame’s YouTube channel** while building it.

The goal of this project is to help me:
- Get familiar with **C#** syntax.
- Learn the **basics of Unity game development**.

If I have time in the future, I might continue to expand and improve this project.
